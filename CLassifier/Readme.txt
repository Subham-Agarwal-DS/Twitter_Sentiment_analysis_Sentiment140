Sentiment.py contains a simple python code to use the model that was created, to predict tweets.
it, however requires an additional embedding model to work, 'tfidf.pkl' which can be generated after you run the 'Sentiment Analysis-part2.ipynb' 

this 'tfidf.pkl' is too large to put on GitHub, hence unable to put it here.
